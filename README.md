# 1806ICT Programming Fundamentals

## Centralised resources 

I created this repo so that we can share resources and code for this course that we can all access. If you have anything to add, submit a pull request and I'll  accept it! If you want to submit your own code, be sure to create a folder with your name/handle with your solutions in it, but if you just want to add general stuff you can add it in the root folder.
